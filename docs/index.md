# Degree Calculation using Greedy Optimisation Algorithm

This task implements a **degree classification system** for students using a **greedy optimisation algorithm**. It calculates weighted averages for Level 5 and Level 6 modules, applies university regulations, and produces final degree classifications automatically.

Key objectives:

- Automate student degree calculations  
- Apply **UWE regulations** accurately  
- Use a **greedy algorithm** for selecting the best 100 credits from Level 5  
- Generate CSV and summary reports for students and faculty
